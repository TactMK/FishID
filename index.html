    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: 12.12.24</p>

<main>
    <p>Thank you for choosing Fish ID (“the App”). The App helps users identify and classify fish species using image recognition, 
    facilitated by third-party AI services. It does not use its own proprietary model; rather, it relies on external services. By 
    downloading, accessing, or using the App, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <p>If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not use the App.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>1.1 Personal Information</h3>
    <p><strong>User Identifiers:</strong> When you use the App, we may assign a unique user ID. This ID helps us manage your subscriptions, 
    maintain service continuity, and understand usage patterns without directly linking activities to your real identity.</p>
    <p><strong>Subscription and Purchase Information:</strong> If you subscribe to our premium services (including automatic weekly renewals), 
    we collect information related to your subscription status and purchase history. This may include subscription type, duration, renewal status, 
    transaction identifiers, and payment confirmation records from our subscription service provider, 
    <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/">RevenueCat</a>.</p>

    <h3>1.2 Usage Information</h3>
    <p><strong>Analytics Data (Amplitude):</strong> We use <a href="https://amplitude.com/">Amplitude</a>, a third-party analytics service, 
    to understand how you interact with the App. Data includes screens viewed, buttons pressed, and duration of feature usage. We use this 
    information solely to improve the App’s functionality, design, and performance.</p>

    <p><strong>Fish Image Analysis and Classification:</strong> You may capture images directly within the App or upload images from your device’s 
    photo library for classification. These images are processed through AI models provided by 
    <a href="https://openai.com/">OpenAI</a> (using the “gpt-4o-mini” model) and facilitated by 
    <a href="https://aiproxy.io/">AIProxy</a>.<br>
    <em>Image Handling:</em> Photos remain on your device unless you choose to classify them. When you request classification, the image is transmitted 
    securely to the external service for processing.<br>
    <em>Storage of Images:</em> We do not permanently store your images on our servers. Images are used only as needed to process your request and 
    then are discarded.<br>
    <em>Non-Fish Images:</em> If the submitted image does not contain a fish, the classification request returns an error. We do not store these 
    non-fish images.</p>

    <h3>1.3 Device and Technical Information</h3>
    <p><strong>Device Data:</strong> We may collect device model, operating system version, language settings, and unique identifiers.</p>
    <p><strong>Log Data:</strong> Our servers may automatically record certain information (“Log Data”) such as IP addresses, App version, 
    request times/dates, and general usage patterns.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the collected information to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Provide and Improve the App:</strong> Understand usage patterns to enhance features, reliability, and user experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Process Subscriptions and Purchases:</strong> Manage payment verification, subscription renewals, and account authentication via RevenueCat.</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics and Performance:</strong> Use Amplitude data to guide improvements.</li>
        <li><strong>Research and Development:</strong> Refine the fish identification process. Any temporarily stored data is anonymized or de-identified.</li>
        <li><strong>Customer Support:</strong> Assist with inquiries, troubleshoot problems, and provide technical support.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The primary purpose of using your data is to improve the App’s functionality and enhance the user experience.</p>

    <h2>3. AI Classification, Accuracy, and Disclaimers</h2>

    <h3>3.1 Third-Party AI Services</h3>
    <p>The App uses the “gpt-4o-mini” model and related APIs from OpenAI, via AIProxy, to classify and identify fish species. The App itself 
    does not have its own model; it only provides an interface for these external services.</p>

    <h3>3.2 Accuracy Disclaimer</h3>
    <p>The classification and identification results may be incomplete, inaccurate, or contain errors. They are generated by advanced machine learning 
    models but are not guaranteed to be correct. The information is for informational purposes only and should not be considered definitive or expert advice.</p>

    <h3>3.3 Limitation of Liability</h3>
    <p>By using the App, you acknowledge and agree that the classification results are provided “as is” and “as available.” You should verify 
    results independently and not rely solely on the App’s output for important decisions. As an individual developer, I am not liable for any 
    inaccuracies, errors, or outcomes related to these results.</p>

    <p>For more details about the services we use, please refer to their respective websites:</p>

    <h2>4. Disclosure of Your Information</h2>

    <h3>4.1 Service Providers</h3>
    <p>We use third-party providers for payment processing (RevenueCat), analytics (Amplitude), and AI processing (OpenAI, AIProxy). They only 
    access your information as needed and must not use it for other purposes.</p>

    <h3>4.2 Legal Requirements</h3>
    <p>We may disclose your information if required by law or if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to comply with legal 
    obligations, protect our rights, investigate wrongdoing, or ensure the safety of users or the public.</p>

    <h3>4.3 Business Transfers</h3>
    <p>In the event of a merger, acquisition, asset sale, or similar transaction, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction. 
    We will provide notice before it becomes subject to a different policy.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Storage and Security</h2>

    <h3>5.1 Data Retention</h3>
    <p>We retain personal information only as long as necessary for the purposes described or as required by law. Images processed for 
    classification are not stored permanently. Any temporarily stored data is anonymized and kept only for short durations to improve services.</p>

    <h3>5.2 Security Measures</h3>
    <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your data against unauthorized access, loss, misuse, or alteration. However, no method of 
    transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2>6. Your Choices and Controls</h2>

    <h3>6.1 Access and Correction</h3>
    <p>You may request access to, or updates of, your personal data. Contact us at the email below, and we will respond within a reasonable timeframe.</p>

    <h3>6.2 Opt-Out of Analytics</h3>
    <p>You can limit or disable certain analytics features via your device’s or the App’s settings.</p>

    <h3>6.3 Subscription Management</h3>
    <p>Manage or cancel subscriptions anytime through your device’s account settings or the app store. Uninstalling the App does not 
    automatically cancel your subscription.</p>

    <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not intended for children under 13 (or the applicable age of majority). We do not knowingly collect personal information 
    from children. If you believe we have inadvertently collected such information, please contact us so we can remove it.</p>

    <h2>8. International Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>Your data may be transferred to servers outside your jurisdiction. In such cases, we take steps to ensure adequate safeguards to protect your information.</p>

    <h2>9. Third-Party Links</h2>
    <p>The App may contain links to external sites or services not operated by us. This Privacy Policy does not apply to these external entities. 
    We recommend reviewing their privacy policies.</p>

    <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in practices or legal requirements. We will notify you by posting the new policy 
    in the App or on our website. Continued use of the App after changes signifies acceptance of the updated terms.</p>

    own the underlying AI model.</p>
